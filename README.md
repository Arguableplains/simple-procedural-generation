# Procedural Generation - OpenGL
My path on OpenGL continues with the procedural generation of data, which is used to make things to seem not so predictable as they should be

With that in mind, this program was designed to generate an infinite number of rods that diverge on their starting angle randomically

Those rods keep being united to the last ones generated, forming a continuos line of selected paths by through the generation can keep going

If you want to run it on your PC, be sure to have Cmake, make and the libraries (OpenGL, glfw and GLEW) installed

## Cmake Steps

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ./..
    make

And if you have any tip or suggestion to my code, feel free to contact me!
